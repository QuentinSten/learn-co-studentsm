# Fancytree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mar10/fancytree.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mar10/fancytree)

Fancytree is a JavaScript dynamic tree view plugin for jQuery with support for 
persistence, keyboard, checkboxes, tables, drag'n'drop, and lazy loading.

Fancytree 2.x is the designated successor of [DynaTree 1.x](https://code.google.com/p/dynatree/).


## Status

Concerning performance and functionality I would classify this project *Beta*.

However, one main motivation of this rewrite was a more consistent and intuitive 
API, so this is also a Call for comments: [let me know], if you have proposals 
for improvements on the API or architecture.  
This implies, that the API is not finalized yet: events, functions, and parameters
are still subject to change.  


#### Latest Changes

  * **2013-08-31** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `onCustomRender` to `renderTitle`.  
    `renderTitle`, `renderNode` and `createNode` events are only triggered as options callback (not DOM events), for performance reasons.
  * **2013-08-25** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `data.orgEvent` to `data.originalEvent`
  * **2013-08-17** [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed events to camelCase as suggested by the jQuery style guide (`rendernnode` -> `renderNode`, ...)
