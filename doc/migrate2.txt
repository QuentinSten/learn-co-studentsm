Dynatree 2 Migration
====================

node.data removed:
  Dynatree 1:
    node.bExpanded = true  // current status
    node.bSelected = true 
    node.data.expand = false  // status read from initialization source
  Dynatree 2:
    node.expanded = true  // current status


Class names for initialization are now unified with node property names:
  Dynatree 1:
    <li class='expond'>
  Dynatree 2:
    <li class='expanded'>


Option cickFolderMode was removed:
  Dynatree 1:
    
  Dynatree 2: override nodeActivate instead
